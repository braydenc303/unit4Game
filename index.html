        <h1>Crystal Collector!</h1>

         <div class = "instructions">
            <p>Each round of this game will begin by giving you a random goal between 19-120 for the number of
            points to meet.
            </p>

            <p>You will be given four randomly arranged crystals with unknown point values. It is your job to 
            determine how many points each crystal grants you, and in what order you need to click on them in
            order to match the goal for the round.
            </p>

            <p>If you can match the goal exactly you win. Be careful though, because if you go over you lose.          
            </p>

            <p>Good Luck!</p>
